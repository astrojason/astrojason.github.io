Sometimes you just need to get the crap together. My writing folders and files are a complete mess.

I have _v1, _old, _crap versions of some of the stuff I have been working on and it makes no sense since I use Scrivener to write. I can keep everything in the same file.

This also makes it much easier to find the previous versions because sometimes, surprisingly enough, there is some good stuff in there.
